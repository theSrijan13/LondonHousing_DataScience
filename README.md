# LondonHousing_DataScience

This data science project aims to analyze and explore the housing market in London. It utilizes publicly available datasets related to London housing to gain insights, make predictions, and provide useful information to potential homebuyers, real estate agents, and investors.
# Project Overview
The project involves the following main steps:

1) Data Acquisition: Gathering relevant datasets containing information about London housing. This may include sources such as government websites, real estate platforms, and open data repositories.

2) Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and transforming the acquired data to ensure its quality, consistency, and suitability for analysis. This step may involve handling missing values, addressing outliers, and performing feature engineering.

3) Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducting a thorough exploration of the data to understand its characteristics, identify patterns, and gain initial insights. EDA may include statistical analysis, data visualization, and correlation studies.

4) Feature Selection: Identifying the most relevant features (variables) that significantly influence housing prices or other target variables. This step involves statistical techniques, domain knowledge, and machine learning algorithms.

5) Model Development: Building predictive models to estimate housing prices or other target variables. This may involve regression algorithms such as linear regression, decision trees, or ensemble methods. Model evaluation and selection are essential steps to ensure reliable predictions.
6) Deployment and Visualization: Creating an interactive interface or dashboard to present the findings and predictions derived from the developed models. This step aims to provide an intuitive and user-friendly experience for exploring the data and accessing the project's insights.
