## Introduction
The London Housing Data Analysis project aims to investigate housing trends, prices, and other relevant metrics in London. By utilizing R and RStudio, we can perform data cleaning, visualization, and statistical analysis to derive meaningful insights from the dataset.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this analysis is sourced from Kaggle. It contains information on house prices, sales volumes, and other relevant data points from different boroughs in London.

## Installation
To run this analysis, you need to have R and RStudio installed on your machine. Follow the instructions below to set up your environment:

Install R from CRAN.
Install RStudio from RStudio.
Additionally, you need to install the required R packages. You can do this by running the following commands in your R console:
install.packages(c("dplyr", "ggplot2", "readr", "lubridate", "tidyr"))
Usage
To run the analysis, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/london-housing-analysis.git
cd london-housing-analysis
Open the london-housing-analysis.Rproj file in RStudio.

Run the R scripts located in the scripts directory. Start with data_cleaning.R to clean and preprocess the data, then proceed to data_analysis.R for the analysis and visualizations.
